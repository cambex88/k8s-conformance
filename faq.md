# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the cost of certification?

For [members](https://www.cncf.io/about/members/) of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, there is no charge for
certification. There is also no charge for non-profit organizations. For commercial organizations that wish to
certify but don't want to become a CNCF member, the fee is the same as [joining](https://www.cncf.io/about/join/) the CNCF.

## What about community distributions?

For the purposes of certification, we treat community distributions/installers as non-profit organizations, so
there is no charge. However, we do require an individual to complete the certification
[agreement](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/blob/master/participation-form/Certified_Kubernetes_Form.md) so
that we have an official contact if your software falls out of compliance.

## How can I track issues that have been opened regarding certification?

When a platform or distribution fails certification, the issue could be in the implementation or in the conformance
tests. We use a [tracking issue.](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/issues/27) to record issues with the
tests.

## What versions of Kubernetes can be certified?

Certification is available for Kubernetes versions 1.7 and higher.
